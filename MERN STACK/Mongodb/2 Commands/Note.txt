 In newer versions of the MongoDB shell (mongosh), the output format has changed slightly.

What's Happening?
Older Versions (mongo shell - Deprecated)

Displayed BSON-like output with double quotes around keys, making it look closer to JSON:
json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("65a2bcde1234f67890abcd12"),
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "position": "Developer"
}
Newer Versions (mongosh - Current MongoDB Shell)

The shell now prints documents in a JavaScript-like object notation (closer to how Node.js handles objects):
js
{
  _id: ObjectId("65a2bcde1234f67890abcd12"),
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 30,
  position: "Developer"
}
Notice that key names are no longer wrapped in double quotes, making it look more like a JavaScript object rather than JSON.

when we write mongosh in mongo shell how it connect with mongodb server and whats the role of db here ?

How mongosh Connects to MongoDB Server and the Role of db
When you start mongosh (MongoDB Shell), it establishes a connection to the MongoDB server. Let's break it down step by step:

1. How mongosh Connects to MongoDB Server?
When you type:

sh
mongosh
ðŸ‘‰ The shell attempts to connect to the MongoDB server running on localhost:27017 (default port).

Connection Process:
Checks for MongoDB Server

mongosh looks for a MongoDB server running on mongodb://localhost:27017.
If a server is running, it connects automatically.
If a Different Host/Port is Required

You can explicitly specify the host and port:
sh
 mongosh "mongodb://your-server-ip:your-port"
Example:
sh
 mongosh "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27018"
(Connects to MongoDB running on port 27018 instead of 27017.)
Authentication (If Required)
If your MongoDB server requires authentication:

sh
 mongosh "mongodb://username:password@your-server-ip:27017/admin"
(This connects with a username and password to the admin database.)

2. What is the Role of db?
Once connected, mongosh assigns db as a global variable representing the current database.

Default Behavior
When you connect, db refers to the default database (test).
You can check this by typing:
js
 db
Output:
sh
 test
(Meaning db is pointing to the test database.)
Switching Databases
To switch to another database, use:

js
 use myDatabase
ðŸ‘‰ Now, db refers to myDatabase.

Using db
Check the current database:
js
 db.getName();
List all collections:
js
 db.getCollectionNames();
Query a collection:
js
 db.users.find();
(Here, db.users refers to the users collection in the currently selected database.)
Summary
âœ… mongosh connects to MongoDB on localhost:27017 by default.
âœ… db is a global variable that refers to the currently selected database.
âœ… You can switch databases using use <databaseName>.

You said:
is mongosh creates a socket connection to deal with mongodb server that same socket connection is used by db ? 
ChatGPT said:
Does mongosh Create a Socket Connection to MongoDB Server?
Yes, mongosh (MongoDB Shell) creates a socket connection to the MongoDB server. The same socket connection is used by db to execute commands.

1. How mongosh Establishes a Connection?
When you start mongosh, it creates a network socket connection to the MongoDB server (mongod process) over TCP/IP (default port 27017).

Steps:
Initiates a TCP Connection

mongosh uses the MongoDB Wire Protocol to communicate with the database server over a TCP socket.
By default, it connects to:
arduino
 mongodb://localhost:27017
You can specify a different server:
sh
 mongosh "mongodb://your-server-ip:your-port"
Authenticates (If Required)

If authentication is enabled, it will require credentials to proceed.
Keeps the Socket Connection Open

Once connected, mongosh maintains a persistent socket connection with the server until you exit.
The same connection is used for running queries and commands.
2. What is the Role of db?
db is a JavaScript variable in mongosh that represents the currently selected database.
It does not create a new connection; instead, it uses the existing socket connection established by mongosh.
Example:
js
 db.users.find();
Here, db.users.find() sends a query through the same socket connection that mongosh opened.
3. Is the Same Connection Used for Multiple Commands?
Yes!

All commands issued in mongosh share the same socket connection.
If you type:
js
 db.getName();   // Uses the same socket
db.users.find(); // Uses the same socket
db.orders.count(); // Uses the same socket
âœ” All commands reuse the same connection, avoiding unnecessary overhead.
4. When Does the Socket Close?
The socket connection remains open until:

You exit mongosh (using exit or Ctrl+C).
MongoDB server (mongod) shuts down.
A network issue disconnects the client from the server.
ðŸ”¹ Summary
âœ… mongosh creates a single socket connection to the MongoDB server.
âœ… All commands (including db operations) use this socket connection.
âœ… The connection remains open until explicitly closed or an error occurs.

You said:
is mongo shell a client ? 
ChatGPT said:
Yes, Mongo Shell (mongosh) is a client for MongoDB.

ðŸ”¹ What is a Client in MongoDB?
A client is any application or tool that connects to a MongoDB server (mongod process) to send commands and retrieve data.

ðŸ”¹ Why is mongosh a Client?
âœ” It connects to the MongoDB server (mongod) over a network socket (typically localhost:27017).
âœ” It sends commands (queries, inserts, updates, deletes) to MongoDB using the MongoDB Wire Protocol.
âœ” It receives responses from the server and displays results in the shell.

ðŸ”¹ How mongosh Works as a Client?
You Start the Client (mongosh)

sh
 mongosh
This launches the MongoDB shell.
It tries to connect to the MongoDB server at mongodb://localhost:27017.
mongosh Establishes a Connection

It creates a TCP/IP socket connection to communicate with the server.
You Run MongoDB Commands

Example:
js
 db.users.find();
This sends a query request to the server.
The server processes it and returns the data.
The Client Receives and Displays Data

The response from the MongoDB server is displayed in the shell.
Client Stays Connected Until You Exit

The connection remains open until you type:
sh
 exit
Or press Ctrl+C.
ðŸ”¹ Other MongoDB Clients
Apart from mongosh, other MongoDB clients include: âœ” MongoDB Drivers (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)
âœ” MongoDB Compass (GUI-based client)
âœ” Mongosh in VS Code (MongoDB Extension)

ðŸ”¹ Summary
âœ… Mongo Shell (mongosh) is a MongoDB client.
âœ… It connects to the MongoDB server, sends commands, and retrieves data.
âœ… It communicates over a network socket using the MongoDB Wire Protocol.
