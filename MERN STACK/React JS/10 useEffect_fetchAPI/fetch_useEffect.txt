if we use fetch method inside any method then is it mandatory to use it in useEffect ? 

Using the `fetch` method inside a method does not necessarily require you to use it within a `useEffect` hook, but the decision depends on the specific use case and requirements of your application.

The `fetch` method is commonly used to make network requests (e.g., API calls) in JavaScript applications. When using it inside a component method (outside of a `useEffect` hook), it might result in the fetch operation being triggered every time the method is called, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or excessive network requests.

If you want to ensure that the `fetch` operation is triggered at a specific time or when certain dependencies change, using `fetch` within a `useEffect` hook can provide better control and alignment with the component lifecycle. The `useEffect` hook allows you to specify when the fetch operation should occur based on the component's mounting, updating, and unmounting phases.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
      const jsonData = await response.json();
      setData(jsonData);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData(); // Fetch data when the component mounts or when certain dependencies change
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means the effect runs only once on mount

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Render your component using the fetched data */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `fetchData` function is defined within the component, and it's called within the `useEffect` hook. This ensures that the data fetching operation is performed when the component mounts (due to the empty dependency array) or when specific dependencies change.

While it's not mandatory to use `fetch` within a `useEffect` hook, doing so can help you manage the timing and behavior of the fetch operation more effectively, especially in scenarios where you need to coordinate data fetching with the component's lifecycle or other state changes.
