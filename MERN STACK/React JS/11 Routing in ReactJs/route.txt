Routing :  Routing means giving path
 Want to show components on different page (having different links) is basically routing is.

Install routing package
npm install react-router-dom

import package by : 
import {BrowserRouter as Router, Route,Link} from react-router-dom
Here we use "as" simply for writing BrowserRouter in short form and that short form we write it Router . Router name which we have given here is userdefined.
