Procedure Oriented Programming language
---------------------------------------
It is a way of writing a list of instructions for the computer to follow and this instructions are arranged in a group and this groups are known as functions.

Characteristics of POP's : 
--------------------------
1. Here Large programs are divided into smaller programs which are known as functions.
2. Data revolves around the system.
3. Functions can access global data.
4. Functions can transform data.
5. Follows top down approach.

Object Oriented programming language
------------------------------------
It is a way of modularizing a program which allocates partitioned memory area for both data and function and using them as a template and call the copies of such modules on demand.

Characteristics of OOP's:
-------------------------
1. Here large programs are divided into what are known as objects.
2. Follows bottom to up approach.
3. Data is hidden and cannot be accessible from outside world. 
4. Objects may communicate with each other through functions.
5. New data can be added anywhere when ever required. 

Oop's Concept : 
---------------
1. Object
    -- object is a real world entity and also termed as a run time entity.
    -- every object have some physical existance that why we can call it as a physical entity.
    -- Every object belongs to some specific class.
    -- objects may communicate with each other through functions.
    -- every object have some state(data composition) and behaviour.

2. Class
    -- class is a userdefined blueprint for creating objects.
    -- class is a logical entity.
    -- class consists of data members and member functions
    -- we can create n number of objects in a class
    
3. Inheritance
4. Encapsulation
5. Abstraction
6. Polymorphism


Object oriented vs object based programming language
---------------     ------------------------------
Language follows all oops concept = object oriented programming language
Language follows all oops concept except inheritance and run time polymorphism = object based programming lannguage (ADA)

purely object oriented programming language vs fully object oriented programming language : 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

A language follows all oops concepts = fully object oriented prog. language
ex: c++, java

A language which is completely dependent upon object is considered as purely object oriented programming language . ex: smalltalk
