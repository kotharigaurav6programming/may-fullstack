Interface : 
-----------

1. With the help of Interface we can achieve 100% abstraction.
2. Interface is used to achieve loose coupling.
3. It is also helpful in achieving the functionality of multiple inheritance in java. 
4. We define interface by interface keyword.
   syntax : 
                interface <interface_name>{

                }  
    example : 
                interface Showable{
                    .....
                }
5. Methods(member functions) inside interface is by default public abstract and data members are by default public static final.

           show(){                zoom
            5 users                show(){
            chating                  100 users
           }                         chating  
                                     whiteboard
                                     documents share
                                     } 

6. Interface extends Interface, whereas class implements Interface
7. In java8, we can also gives the definition part of method with the help of default and static keywords.
8. In Java9, we can also create private method inside interface
